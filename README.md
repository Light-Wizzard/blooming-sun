Blender Animation of the Sun removing the hard edge making the Sun Bloom

I started working on this project back in 2012, 

Input image from NASA is 4096 x 4096:

Output image from NASA is 4096 x 4096: 

You can see a vertical line, and a hard line on the left, not what I wanted, and why I never used this project, I would have to look up the old thread, but someone helped me by making this file, but had not time to explain it, nor help me to prefect it, and I am at a lost, so I am hoping someone can help me, I do not care if I use this methode, the old methode I tried to mask out the edges, but it reduces the size of the bloom, and this method is too close to the sun, I only want to extend the bloom, and not create one, as this is doing now.

I started this project using a 66" Projector TV, it looked good on it, but after upgrading to 4K, it looks ugly, see my attemps at the link below, and also note that I am not using this Blender Project, but another one, where I tried to mask out the hard line, and add stars, on my projector I did not see the mask, in 4K I can.

I have looked at using graphic tools like Image Magic, and GIMP, to alter the images adding the bloom, but ran into the same issue, I am trying to extend the bloom, so I have to know where it is at, and then grab maybe 10 pixels, and blur them side ways, and make it tapper off to look like the real bloom would have worked, if NASA just zoomed out a bit, to get the whole bloom.
